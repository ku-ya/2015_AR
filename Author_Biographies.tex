\noindent\textbf{Kuya Takami} is pursuing his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech), USA. He previously earned his B.S. and M.S. at University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2008, and 2011. He works under Computational Multi-physics and Systems Laboratory, and National Science Foundation funded Center for Tire Research. His primary interests expands in acoustic, and experimental/ computational mechanics and robotics fields. He has worked on autonomous driving based on simultaneous localization and mapping, and currently working on non-field-of-view acoustic target localization and noise prediction of the automotive tires.
